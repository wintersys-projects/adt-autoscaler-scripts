# Description : This will setup the configuration file for the current s3 interaction tool
# a template is held in the configfiles subdirectory if needed with placeholders that
# this script replaces with "live" values. If there is a change to the format that a
# later version of the current s3 tool needs needs then the template in the "configfiles"
# subdirectory will have to be updated to reflect the needed changes. 
# I did some experimenting and this was the easiest and cleanest way I could come up
# with for generating these configuration files.
