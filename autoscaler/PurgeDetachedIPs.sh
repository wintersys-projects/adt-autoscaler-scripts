# Description:  If a webserver is inadvertently destroyed from the gui or from a command line
# command, then its IP address will be left registered with the DNS provider which means that
# it will be included in the round robin sequence but with no webserver to fulfill any requests
# This script will monitor for ip addresses that do not have a corresponding server running
# and remove the ip addresses that are not required from the DNS provider thus making sure
# that all registered ip addresses have an associated webserver to fulfil them.
# This script is called every minute from cron and so is quite "on it" if a machine has been
# destroyed by a 3rd party
