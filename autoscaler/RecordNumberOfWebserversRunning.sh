# Description : This just keeps a record of how many webservers are running so we can look back
# over time and see how many webservers have been active at any given moment in time
# This might be useful if you have had some network outage and machines are considered
# offline through no fault of their own and you want to look back and see what the profile
# of machines being destroyed and rebuilt was
