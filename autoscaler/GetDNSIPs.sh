# Description: This script will get a list of all ip addresses registered and active with the DNS provider
# If an IP address appears in this list that machine is basically considerded a "live" webserver
# This won't return IP addresses of machines that are merely "booted" and "ready" it will only apply IP
# addresses of machines that have been built and had their IP addresses added to the DNS provider
# The list of IP addresses that are returned are the IP addresses of machines that can be considered "live"
