# Description:  This script will create Webservers up to the defined number of webservers
# required when there's not enough. You might be running multiple autoscalers in which case
# this script is set up to loadbalance the webservers to be built between the autoscalers.
# This is not partcularly heavy work for the autoscalers to do but you might want to have 
# multiple autoscalers for architectual resilience like you might like to have multiple
# webservers for the same reason.
