# Description: This script will take an ip address as a parameter and using the AddRecord.sh script
# from the providerscripts adds the ip address to the DNS service provider.
# It checks that the record doesn't already exist with the DNS provider before it is added and also
# removes any possibility of the machine to which the IP address belongs being a potentially stalled 
# build - it can't be, because we are satisfied that the IP address needs to be added
