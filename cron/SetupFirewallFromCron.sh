# Description: This script is called from cron and sets up the UFW firewall. It is called
# repeatedly as a way of aggressively ensuring that the firewall is enabled, but, once
# the firewall is enabled a flag is set and checked each time this is called meaning
# this effectively does nothing once the firewall is configured.
